There are many things you can do with this, one of them being :

View the Mac keyboard on Scratch with ease! (I also added Windows ðŸ˜„) I do not need to go into that much detail because this is really simple. At the top you can see a mini mapout (from the Apple digital store) and when you click on the button you can see my very own digitally - drawn one!

It is maybe not the best option, but I am new to the whole chrome extensions thing. When there was no tutorial for something, I had to ask AI how to use that command in particular. I also added some of the comments it suggested because that way YOU can also modify it!

WAIT JUST A MINUTE! I forgot to mention how to use this! Go to this link :
chrome://extensions/
After that turn on developer mode. Click "Load unpacked" and select the file.
It also must be a folder, not a .zip file!
